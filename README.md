## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control is a system that allows you to look back at specific versions of files or sets of files after changes. A Version Control System &lpar;VCS&rpar; can be very useful for graphic or web designers who want to keep every version of a specific image or layout.
2. Git was developed to include key features prioritized by programmers such as speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, full distribution, and the ability to handle large projects efficiently.
3. A VCS creates something of a security net so that if you lose files or make mistakes it is easier to recover.
