            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that allows you to look back at specific versions of files or sets of files after changes. A Version Control System &lpar;VCS&rpar; can be very useful for graphic or web designers who want to keep every version of a specific image or layout. A VCS allows the user to revert files back to a previous state, view changes over time, see who last modified something and find the source of various problems. A VCS creates something of a security net so that if you lose files or make mistakes it is easier to recover. Centralized Version Control Systems &lpar;CVCS&rpar; were developed to allow people to collaborate with developers on other systems.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began in 2005 and has evolved in many ways, becoming easy to use and yet still remaining true to its intended purposes. Git was developed when the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel &lpar;an open source software project&rpar; and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down. This inspired the Linux development community to develop their own tool, which became Git. Git was developed to include key features prioritized by programmers such as speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development, full distribution, and the ability to handle large projects efficiently. Git is unique from other VCSs and it is important to know the differences to avoid becoming confused.

                <span class="text-muted">What are they?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main states that your files can be in:  committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.  Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. There are also three main sections of a Git project: The Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area. The Git work flow starts in the working tree where you modify your files, next you selectively stage the changes you want to be part of your next commit, finally you do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores them permanently to the directory.

                <span class="text-muted">How to</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You can get a Git repository in one of two ways. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control and turn it into a Git repository, or you can clone a Git repository that already exists. If you choose the first way, you first need to go to the projectâ€™s directory which creates a new subdirectory that will contain all of your needed files. If you choose an existing Git repository such as a project you would like to contribute to, you clone it. By doing this Git receives a full copy of almost all of the data that the server has.

                <span class="text-muted">Why is it special?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is unique for several reasons. Git think about data differently than any other VCSs. Other systems such as CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar etc think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time, known as delta-based version control. Git thinks of data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. This makes Git reconsider almost every aspect of version control that most other systems copied from previous generations. Git is also extremely fast compared to other VSCs because it only need local files and resources to operate.
